Hello, there ✌

My name is Felipe and I'm a full-stack web development student from Manaus, Amazonas. 
Currently learning and improving skills in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and frameworks such as React and Node.js. 
With each line of code, I am more fascinated by the infinite possibilities that technology offers to transform ideas into reality. 
I love technology and my goal is to create amazing websites and apps that solve real-world problems while looking beautiful on every device. 
I'm currently studying Computer Engineering in the 6th period and developing personal projects.

Here's some of the stuff that I'm studying
